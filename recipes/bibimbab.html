    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Sizzling and satisfying, Dolsot Bibimbap is a Korean rice dish served in a hot stone bowl, where perfectly crisped rice meets vibrant vegetables, savory marinated meat, and a spicy-sweet kick of gochujang sauce. Topped with a fried egg and mixed tableside, every bite is a symphony of textures and bold flavors!</p>
